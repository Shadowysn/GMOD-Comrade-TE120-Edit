# GMOD-Comrade-TE120-Edit
In the Zero Point Energy Projector folder:

An edited version of Comrade Communist's TE120 gun. I do not own the actual mod.

In the Concussion Gun (Mine) folder:

A very W.I.P. version of a seperate concussion gun supposed to not use any code from Comrade's version, except as placeholders.

Edited and posted by Shadowysn.

Look at the README file in GMOD-SCGG-Fixed for the instructions in installing this mod.

Please do not upload to the workshop or any other website without Comrade's permission.
